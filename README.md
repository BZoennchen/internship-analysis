# Interactive Visualizations – EDUCON 2026

This repository contains the interactive visualizations that accompany the paper:

**_An AI-Based Toolchain to Align Curricular Competencies with Internship Experiences_**  
to be presented at **IEEE EDUCON 2026**.

➡️ **Live interactive plots:** https://bzoennchen.github.io/internship-analysis/

The visualizations provide an interactive extension of the results reported in the paper.  
They enable exploration of:

- Topic clusters extracted from anonymized internship reports  
- Professional tasks and their cognitive complexity  
- Sector classifications and distributions across study programs  
- Alignments between internship tasks and curricular learning outcomes  

The goal is to increase transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of the findings beyond static figures in the publication.

All internship data used for analysis and visualization was **fully anonymized** in accordance with institutional and data protection requirements.
