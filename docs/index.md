This page provides the interactive visualizations accompanying the paper:

**_An AI-Based Toolchain to Align Curricular Competencies with Internship Experiences_**  
presented at **[IEEE EDUCON 2026](https://2026.ieee-educon.org/)**.

The visualizations offer an interactive exploration of the results generated in the study, including topic models, sector analyses, and task clusters derived from anonymized internship reports. They are intended to complement the static figures shown in the publication by enabling readers to explore individual data points, topics, and cluster relationships in detail.

To preserve privacy, all internship content was fully anonymized prior to analysis and visualization.

Please refer to the paper when interpreting these plots.
